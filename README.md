`go-oapi-merge` is a CLI tool for merging OpenAPI YAML files. It resolves `$ref` references across multiple files and combines them into a single, unified OpenAPI specification. Perfect for managing large or modular OpenAPI projects.

---

## Features

- **Resolves `$ref` References**: Automatically resolves and merges external references in OpenAPI files.
- **Simple CLI Interface**: Easy-to-use command-line tool for quick integration into your workflow.
- **Customizable Input/Output**: Specify input and output file paths for flexible usage.
- **Cross-Platform**: Built in Go, it works seamlessly on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

---

## Installation

Install `go-oapi-merge` using `go install`:

```bash
go install github.com/NoL1m1ts/go-oapi-merge@latest
```

---

## Usage

### CLI Command

```bash
go-oapi-merge -input <input_file> -output <output_file>
```

#### Options

| Flag      | Description                              | Required | Default Value   |
|-----------|------------------------------------------|----------|-----------------|
| `-input`  | Path to the main OpenAPI file.           | No       | `api.yaml`      |
| `-output` | Path to save the merged OpenAPI file.    | No       | `merged_api.yaml` |

#### Examples

```bash
# Basic usage with default values
go-oapi-merge

# Specify custom input and output files
go-oapi-merge -input specs/main.yaml -output dist/merged.yaml

# Using relative paths
go-oapi-merge -input ./api/openapi.yaml -output ./dist/final.yaml
```

#### Error Handling

The tool will display error messages in the following cases:
- Input file doesn't exist or is not accessible
- Input file is not a valid YAML
- Output directory doesn't exist or is not writable
- Referenced files (`$ref`) are missing or invalid
- Invalid OpenAPI specification format

Example error output:
```bash
Error: open api.yaml: no such file or directory
```

---

## How It Works

1. **Reads the Main File**: The tool starts by reading the main OpenAPI file specified with the `-input` flag.
2. **Resolves References**: It identifies `$ref` references, reads the linked files, and merges their content into the main file.
3. **Saves the Result**: The final merged OpenAPI specification is saved to the file specified with the `-output` flag.

---

## Example Project Structure

Hereâ€™s an example of a modular OpenAPI project:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ api.yaml
â”œâ”€â”€ paths
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ user.yaml
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pet.yaml
â””â”€â”€ components
    â””â”€â”€ schemas.yaml
```

The `api.yaml` file contains references to other files:

```yaml
paths:
  /user:
    $ref: "./paths/user.yaml#/paths/~1user"
  /pet:
    $ref: "./paths/pet.yaml#/paths/~1pet"
```

After running `go-oapi-merge`, the tool will merge all referenced files into a single `merged_api.yaml`.

## Example Project Structure with Example Files

The repository includes example files in the `examples` directory that demonstrate the recommended structure and usage:

```
examples/
â”œâ”€â”€ api.yaml                 # Main OpenAPI file
â”œâ”€â”€ paths/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ users.yaml          # User endpoints
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pets.yaml           # Pet endpoints
â””â”€â”€ components/
    â””â”€â”€ schemas.yaml        # Shared schemas
```

### Main File (api.yaml)
```yaml
openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: Example API
  version: 1.0.0
paths:
  /users:
    $ref: './paths/users.yaml#/paths/users'
  /pets:
    $ref: './paths/pets.yaml#/paths/pets'
components:
  schemas:
    $ref: './common/schemas.yaml#/common/schemas'
```

You can use these examples as a starting point:
```bash
# Copy examples to your project
cp -r examples/* your-project/

# Run merge on example files
go-oapi-merge -input examples/api.yaml -output merged_api.yaml
```
